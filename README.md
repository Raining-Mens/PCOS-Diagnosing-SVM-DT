# PCOS and Ovarian Cancer Diagnosing Tool

The researchers developed **ADASYN-ENN** as the proposed method that oversampled and undersampled the dataset to balance the classes and remove unnecessary noises during sampling.

The researchers used a public dataset found in **Kaggle**, where 541 patients with their respective symptoms and clinical data were used. Then, the proposed method was implemented to achieve a balanced dataset. After that, the balanced dataset was tested with two machine learning classifiers: **Support Vector Machine** and **Decision Tree**, which are sensitive to imbalanced datasets.
