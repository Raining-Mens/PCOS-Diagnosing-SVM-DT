                        <p class="adasyn">ADASYN-ENN is an ensemble balancing method consists of Adaptive Synthetic and Edited Nearest Neighbor. Adaptive Synthetic 
                            is an over-sampling technique which generates synthetic instances on the region with less positive instances than one with more positive instances
                            to increase the recognition of positive. On the other hand, ENN or Edited Nearest Neighbor is an under-sampling technique that deletes sample sets like
                            noises which can be present after an over-sampling method was processed to the data. ENN is used to remove noisy data that cancel out the flaws of ADASYN,
                            which may result on producing a much robust balanced data for better fitting into classifiers.
